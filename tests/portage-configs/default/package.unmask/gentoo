# Unmask packages that are provided by this overlay but masked in the Gentoo
# repository's package.mask.  In package.mask of ::gentoo, the masked atoms are
# usually written as unversioned ones without the repository name, which
# affects packages in this overlay with the same name too.
#
# Please do not unmask packages which are scheduled for removal from ::gentoo
# and not in this overlay here.  These packages will be eventually deleted from
# ::gentoo, and to keep the ebuilds in this overlay functional, they need to be
# added to this overlay sooner or later.
#
# Only packages that are actually in this overlay should be unmasked.  To
# achieve this, please always specify the repository name in the atoms in this
# file.
#
# Examples:
# dev-java/bytelist::spark-overlay
# dev-java/jcodings::spark-overlay
