As Gentoo will soon start to support selecting JDK 11 as the system VM
on stable keywords, all Java packages in ::spark-overlay have been
updated so they can now be built using JDK 11.  Users can now elect to
use packages in this overlay with Java 11.

New users of this overlay should note that as of 2022-01-22, a few Java
packages in ::gentoo that are depended by packages in this overlay have
JDK 11 build failure bugs, so they must be built with JDK 8:

- dev-java/eclipse-ecj:4.5 [1]
- dev-java/rxtx [2]

All other Java packages provided or needed by this overlay can be built
with JDK 11.

Packages already installed on the system that were built by JDK 8 should
continue to work on JRE 11.  If any runtime error occurs after switching
from JRE 8 to JRE 11, please first perform a @world update to make sure
packages from both ::gentoo and ::spark-overlay are all up-to-date, as
some package updates include fixes for Java 11 issues.  If the problem
persists, please try to rebuild packages from this overlay with JDK 11,
using the following procedure:

1. Use 'eselect java-vm' to ensure that JDK 11 is selected as the system
   VM.  Instructions are available on Gentoo Wiki [3].

2. Install package app-portage/spark-overlay-rebuild, and run command
   'spark-overlay-rebuild' to start rebuilding packages in this overlay.

Before building any Java packages in this overlay with JDK 11, please be
aware that some of the packages are known to have backward compatibility
issues with Java 8 if they were built using JDK 11.  If those packages
have already been built with JDK 11 and need to be used on Java 8, they
must be rebuilt using JDK 8.  This overlay provides another package
app-portage/java-11to8-rebuild that can be used to rebuild them without
rebuilding the entire set of Java packages from this overlay.  For more
information, please see the related discussion thread [4].

Please feel free to use the discussion board [5] for any questions,
suggestions and comments.  Bugs related to packages in this overlay may
be reported to the issue tracker [6].
