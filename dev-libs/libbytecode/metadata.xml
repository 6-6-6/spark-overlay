		This package uses sources from the package maintainer's fork instead of
		vanilla upstream sources because the full vanilla sources of this
		package can only be downloaded from the CVS repository on SourceForge.

		The upstream wrote: "This code was originally part of the f2j back-end
		code generator, but we thought it could be useful in other projects, so
		we split it off into an independent library."
