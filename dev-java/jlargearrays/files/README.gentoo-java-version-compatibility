This package cannot be compatible with both Java 8 and Java >=9 at the
same time because the vanilla upstream source of this package does not
support Java >=9, and upstream's patch that adds Java 9 support is not
backward compatible with Java 8.

As a result, if Java 8 was used to build this package, then using its
JAR with Java >=9 may lead to runtime errors, and vice versa.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the JDK used to build this
package and the JRE used to run any application that depends on this
package are either both for Java 8 or both for Java >=9.

If the JRE version changes either from or to Java 8, then this package
needs to be rebuilt for the new Java version to prevent any runtime
errors.
