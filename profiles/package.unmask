# Unmask any packages masked in the Gentoo repository's profile but are present
# in this overlay here.
#
# Dependencies of packages in this overlay provided by ::gentoo may be
# last-rited (masked) before they are completely removed.  The atoms in
# /var/db/repos/gentoo/profiles/package.mask usually are unversioned and do not
# bear the repository name, so even if this overlay has an ebuild for the same
# ${CATEGORY}/${PN}, it will be masked by ::gentoo's profile.
#
# For this reason, the affected package atoms should be unmasked here so that
# users of this overlay can continue to install a version of those packages
# provided by this overlay.
#
# Please do not unmask packages which have been last-rited in ::gentoo but do
# not exist in this overlay here.  These packages will eventually be deleted
# from ::gentoo, and to keep the ebuilds in this overlay functional, they need
# to be added to this overlay sooner or later.
#
# Please add new entries to the top of this file.  When adding an entry, please
# include the following info:
# a) your name
# b) the date in the UTC timezone
# c) reason for unmasking (usually "Last-rited package which is present in this
#    overlay")
#
# Please try to avoid unmasking packages in ::gentoo by making atoms in this
# file as specific as possible.  For example, if this overlay contains
# app-misc/some-package-2.3.7 but ::gentoo does not have such version, then
# an atom with version specifier should be used so no packages from ::gentoo
# will be unmasked.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Last-rited package which is present in this overlay.  This overlay has
## # version 2.3.7, which is not provided by ::gentoo.
## ~app-misc/some-package-2.3.7
#
# Any atoms for packages that are no longer masked in
# /var/db/repos/gentoo/profiles/package.mask should be cleaned up from this
# file.

#--- END OF EXAMPLES ---

# Yuan Liao <liaoyuan@gmail.com> (2023-03-11)
# Last-rited package which is added to this overlay at version 1.3.3-r2.
>=dev-java/jboss-modules-1.3.3-r2

# Yuan Liao <liaoyuan@gmail.com> (2023-02-20)
# Package last-rited in ::gentoo but already exists in this overlay with
# version 1.1-r2.
>=dev-java/jta-1.1-r2

# Yuan Liao <liaoyuan@gmail.com> (2023-02-20)
# Package without any issues that has been last-rited in ::gentoo; it was
# marked for removal from ::gentoo merely because it was not used by any other
# ::gentoo packages.  However, this overlay has reverse dependencies of it.
>=dev-java/commons-text-1.10.0-r1
>=dev-java/jcip-annotations-1.0.1-r2
