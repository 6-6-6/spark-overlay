# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date
# in the UTC timezone, and an explanation of why something is getting masked.
# Please be extremely careful not to commit atoms that are not valid.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masking these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) any bug # for the removal
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)

# This package's sources are released at an HTTP URL that does not
# contain the package's version number, meaning that there is not a
# permalink to a specific version of the package's sources.  As a
# result, this package is prone to upstream's changes to the sources.
#
# No reverse dependencies left.  Only few other distributions provide
# this package, with the biggest name being Fedora; however, the source
# URI used by the Fedora package returns 404.
#
# Removal on 2023-02-20.
